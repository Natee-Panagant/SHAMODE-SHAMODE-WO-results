Mass Reliability Optimization Results of SHAMODE/SHAMODE-WO


30 independent runs of MOEA/D,MOHS,UPS-EMOA,RPBIL-DE,DEMO,MPSO,SHAMODE,SHAMODE-WO
on 6 truss mass and reliability optimization problems are evaluated.

Source code of all evaluated test problems and Pareto front results are included in rar-file.

All files in this repository are part of research entitled "Simultaneous topology, shape and sizing optimisation
of trusses taking account of uncertainties by using a novel hybrid multiobjective meta-heuristic"
